## Legal and Ethical Standards

# Scenario 1

# Legal Breaches
Depending on what the original terms & condition states, the company may breach legal standards if they do not inform their users about data being shared to a third party company without pulic mention.

# Ethical Concerns
The company are targetting vunerable users that can't pay off their loans, and exploiting them into more debt. Also the lack of tranparency between the company and it's customers is concerning, especially using the terms and conditions changes, knowing noone really reads them.

# Mitigation
Improving communication with customers about new partnerships is the first step towards improving the publicity of the company, also supporting the vunerable users by introducing affordable repayment plans is a sensible and practical way to improve the company's image.


# Scenario 2

# Legal Breaches
There doesnt seem to be any legal breaches, they must follow in app purchase regulations.

# Ethical Concerns
Kids may not have access to certain levels of the game, creating a dynamic of which those that have money may progress with the game more.
Also, addictions could occur, the more they play, the more money they are spending.

# Mitigation
Using monetisation strategies that are fair for all users, for example using ads, or a premium account that gets rid of ads.

# Scenario 3

# Legal Breaches
There must be data protection implemented in order to use these features, for example the user must allow their data to be accessible to other users, and there must be a prompt to allow cookies to be shared to the company for targetted ads.

# Ethical Concerns
Using free trials to lure users into getting the full premium features, by using targetted ads that they may have not agreed to.

# Mitigation
The gap between the free service and the premium shouldnt be a vast difference, with each having similar features but not one hindering the other. Also, ensuring that user's give specific consent to allow their data to be shared.
